## Introduction

This is the project for the ACTAM course, we are Axel and Jiayan(Group7). Since most people's inspirations are fleeting, we developed a virtual keyboard that makes it easy to record music and allow for simple effects. Our aim is that users can compose their music anytime, anywhere.
